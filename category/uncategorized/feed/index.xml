				<description><![CDATA[<p>This past year has been full of valuable meetings and conferences for the SaniPath team and we have been able to both collect more data from our tool as well as begin to publish results. We have outlined some of the highlights.</p>
<p>1. We attended and presented in exciting Sanitation Conferences around the World</p>
<p>Suraja Raj was able to kick off 2015 by representing SaniPath at the Fecal Sludge Management (FSM3) conference in Hanoi, Vietnam in January. She presented on the SaniPath Tool and how it can impact urban sanitation. SaniPath team members Christine Moe, Eddy Perez, Suraja Raj, and David Berendes collaborated with World Bank's Water and Sanitation Program (WSP), and the German Society for International Cooperation (Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit or GIZ) to lead a workshop at FSM3 that focused on the use of diagnostic tools to assess fecal sludge management at a city-wide scale.</p>
